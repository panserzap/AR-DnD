# Realm of AR

In this AR game, made in Unity, players will be able to experience a story fantasy medieval game in a whole new way by using Aruco markers to display various scenes from the game. The Game Master will be able to choose from a variety of different scenes, such as Taverns, Caves, and other locations, and display them simultaneously on the players' mobile phones through the app.

Players will use Aruco markers to display various locations from the fantasy medieval game on their mobile phones so they will be able to see virtual scenes on of the table, bringing the world of a fantasy medieval game to life in a way that has never been before.

The use of Aruco markers allows players to interact with and explore the virtual environments in a more natural and intuitive way, enhancing the overall gameplay experience. For instance, if the players moves their phone closer to the marker, they will be able to see more details on the virtual objects in the scene. Or, if they move their phone to the side, they might be able to see parts of the scene that were previously hidden from view.
